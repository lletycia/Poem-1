# Poem-1

I will not allowed you to broke me
You can have all the reasions, all the facts
You can be totally right 
You can even have the rights
But at the end of the day
I'II not lay...
Under your feet 
I'II not bend to your thoughts
or even tremble couse your words
I'II allowed myself to grow
to see, to feel, to sense the world
As it is...

I will not allowed your fear
Invade my herat,
Ans make me...
As fearfull as you
I'II allowed myself to see the light
I'II allowed myself to fight
For my dreams!

I will not allowed your lies
To rise against me
And when you finelle opne
Your eyes,
Will be to late
For you to state
The true that everyone will see!

you are not trustful
You are not good
And just wanna say it
But I can't
they will not believe
They can not see through
like I can...
but one day I knoe for sure
You will Not hide anumore
They will see what I can see
The crime behind your scene
The arrogance become a sin!
